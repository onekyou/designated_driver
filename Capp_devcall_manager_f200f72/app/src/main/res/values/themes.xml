      Base application theme. 
      We use Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar as the base for Compose.
      The actual theming (colors, typography) is controlled by the CallManagerTheme Composable.
      However, this theme can influence the initial window background, status bar color before Compose takes over.

<!-- 
  Note: For Material 3 Compose apps, the base *activity* theme often doesn't need much customization here 
  as Compose Material 3 handles most UI aspects. 
  Theme.AppCompat.* or Theme.MaterialComponents.* are usually bases for XML view apps. 
  Using android:Theme.Material.Light.NoActionBar is a simple base suitable for a Compose-only activity.
  The important part is that the Activity theme in AndroidManifest.xml matches this style name (@style/Theme.CallManager).
